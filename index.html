    <h2>Tokyo</h2>
        <p>Tokyo (東京, Tōkyō) is Japan's capital and the world's most populous metropolis. 
            It is also one of Japan's 47 prefectures, consisting of 23 central city wards and 
            multiple cities, towns and villages west of the city center. 
            The Izu and Ogasawara Islands are also part of Tokyo.</p>

        <p>Prior to 1868, Tokyo was known as Edo. A small castle town in the 16th century,
            Edo became Japan's political center in 1603 when Tokugawa Ieyasu established his feudal
            government there. A few decades later, Edo had grown into one of the world's most 
            populous cities. With the Meiji Restoration of 1868, the emperor and capital moved 
            from Kyoto to Edo, which was renamed Tokyo ("Eastern Capital"). Large parts of Tokyo 
            were destroyed in the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923 and in the air raids of 1945.</p>

        <p>Today, Tokyo offers a seemingly unlimited choice of shopping, entertainment, culture and 
            dining to its visitors. The city's history can be appreciated in districts such as 
            Asakusa and in many excellent museums, historic temples and gardens. Contrary to common 
            perception, Tokyo also offers a number of attractive green spaces in the city center and 
            within relatively short train rides at its outskirts.</p>

    <h2>Day 1</h2>
        <h3>Where to go</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Asakusa</b></li>
            <p> Asakusa (浅草) is the center of Tokyo's shitamachi (literally "low city"), 
                one of Tokyo's districts, where an atmosphere of the Tokyo of past decades 
                survives.</p>

            <li><b>Sensoji Temple</b></li>
            <p>Sensoji (浅草寺, Sensōji, also known as Asakusa Kannon Temple) is a Buddhist temple 
                located in Asakusa. It is one of Tokyo's most colorful and popular temples.</p>

            <img src="/img/3001_sensoji.jpg" alt="This is an image of sensoji temple" height="200" width="300">

            <li><b>Ueno Park</b></li>
            <p>Ueno Park (上野公園, Ueno Kōen) is a large public park next to Ueno Station in 
                central Tokyo. The park grounds were originally part of Kaneiji Temple, which 
                used to be one of the city's largest and wealthiest temples and a family temple 
                of the ruling Tokugawa clan during the Edo Period. Kaneiji stood in the northeast 
                of the capital to protect the city from evil, much like Enryakuji Temple in Kyoto.</p>

            <li><b>Ameyoko</b></li>
            <p>Ameyoko (アメ横) is a busy market street along the Yamanote Line tracks between 
                Okachimachi and Ueno Stations. The name "Ameyoko" is a short form for "Ameya 
                Yokocho" (candy store alley), as candies were traditionally sold there. 
                Alternatively, "Ame" also stands for "America", because a lot of American products 
                used to be available there when the street was the site of a black market in the 
                years following World War Two.</p>

            <li><b>Tokyo Skytree</b></li>
            <p>The Tokyo Skytree (東京スカイツリー) is a television broadcasting tower and landmark 
                of Tokyo. It is the centerpiece of the Tokyo Skytree Town in the Sumida City Ward, 
                not far away from Asakusa. With a height of 634 meters (634 can be read as "Musashi",
                 a historic name of the Tokyo Region), it is the tallest structure in Japan and the
                  second tallest in the world at the time of its completion.</p>

            <li><b>Sumida Aquarium</b></li>
            <p>The Sumida Aquarium (すみだ水族館, Sumida Suizokukan) is one of the main attractions 
                of the Tokyo Skytree Town complex that was opened in May 2012 in Tokyo. The 
                moderately sized and beautifully designed modern aquarium houses over 10,000 sea 
                creatures on the 5th and 6th floors of Tokyo Solamachi, a shopping and entertainment
                 complex at the base of the Tokyo Skytree.</p>
        </ul>

                    to the site of the former Tsukiji Wholesale Market. It consists of a few blocks
                     of wholseale and retail shops, as well as restaurants crowded along narrow 
                     lanes. Here you can find fresh and processed seafood and produce alongside 
                     food-related goods such as knives.</p>

                <li><b>Tokyo Imperial Palace</b></li>
                <p>The current Imperial Palace (皇居, Kōkyo) is located on the former site of Edo 
                    Castle, a large park area surrounded by moats and massive stone walls in the 
                    center of Tokyo, a short walk from Tokyo Station. It is the residence of Japan's
                     Imperial Family.</p>

                <p>Shinjuku (新宿) is one of the 23 city wards of Tokyo, but the name commonly refers
                     to just the large entertainment, business and shopping area around Shinjuku 
                     Station.</p>

                <li><b>Shinjuku Gyoen</b></li>
                <p>Shinjuku Gyoen (新宿御苑) is one of Tokyo's largest and most popular parks. 
                    Located just a short walk from Shinjuku Station, the paid park's spacious
                     lawns, meandering walking paths and tranquil scenery provide a relaxing 
                     escape from the busy urban center around it. In spring Shinjuku Gyoen 
                     becomes one of the best places in the city to see cherry blossoms.</p>
            </ul>

                     to just the popular shopping and entertainment area found around Shibuya
                      Station. In this regard, Shibuya is one of Tokyo's most colorful and busy
                       districts, packed with shopping, dining and nightclubs serving swarms of
                        visitors that come to the district everyday</p>

                <li><b>Harajuku</b></li>
                <p>Harajuku (原宿) refers to the area around Tokyo's Harajuku Station, which is

                     Japan's most extreme teenage cultures and fashion styles, but also offers
                      shopping for adults and some historic sights.</p>

                <p>Meiji Shrine (明治神宮, Meiji Jingū) is a shrine dedicated to the deified 
                    spirits of Emperor Meiji and his consort, Empress Shoken. Located just beside
